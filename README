STDERR:

    The stderr differences are not interesting, they all have to do with
    manifest issues due to Test-Simple files. Feel free to diff them manually
    there is not much to see.

STDOUT:

    =Number of tests=

    There are a different number of tests run, there are more when using
    Test::Stream. This occurs because there are more files in cpan/Test-Simple
    when using Test-Stream, none of the differences here were interesting.

    =Number of todos=

    There is no differences in todos. Same quantity, same exact output

    =Number of skips=

    There is no difference in the number of skips, however there is a line of
    output that is different, see the check.sh output example below.
    This line is different because of an intentional change to Test::* related
    to how a skip_all is handled in a subtest. This one change is not
    interesting or scary.

check.sh

    This script greps for skips and todos into seperate files, it then cleans
    them up by removing the 'ok \d+' pattern (since test numbers can be
    different ue to random stuff) It then also sorts all lines. Once the files
    are cleaned up it diffs them. The diff is filtered so that you do not see
    Test-Simple or Test/Stream results.

What check.sh currently outputs:
