check.sh reads a complete log from a build of blead and a build of blead
patched for Test2+Test-Simple. It will compare the 2 files and produce output
for inspection. The input files should be a combination of STDOUT and STDERR.

Things it will tell you:

 * How many 'ok' lines were seen
 * How many comments were seen

It will also apply several filters to the files to remove known-patterns that
reflect random behavior in the test suite that add to noise in the diffs. You
can look at check.sh if you are curious about what filters are applied.

After filtering diffs are generated and you are shown:

 * What differences were found in TODO lines
 * What differences were found in SKIP lines
 * What differences were found in OK lines
 * What differences were found in COMMENT lines

.diff files are also generated for each type.
